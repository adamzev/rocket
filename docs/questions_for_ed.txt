With the new A_v formula, does the .6 limit still apply?
With the new A_V formula, does it only apply until we reach max ADC?
at around 210 seconds into flight, he pitches it down before stage separation
What I see is that, after that, we slowly reduce A_v until 2100 feet/s is achieved?
We stick at 2100 feet/s Vv until, stick there for a few seconds (A_v = G), then give back some G until Vv is 1650,
stick there (until 250,000 ft?) and then give back more to 1200 Vv which we stay at for the duration
